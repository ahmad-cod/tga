<!-- Introduction: -->

The article emphasizes the importance of words and text in communication and explains how strings are used
to manipulate text in programming.

<!-- Creating a String:  -->

Strings are created by enclosing text within quotes (either single or double). Examples are provided
to demonstrate the correct syntax and potential errors when creating strings.

<!-- Manipulating Strings:  -->

Various string manipulation techniques are discussed, including concatenation (joining strings
together), accessing individual characters within a string, and using string methods like toUpperCase() and
toLowerCase() to change case.

<!-- Escaping Quotes:  -->

If you need to include quotes within a string, you can use the backslash () as an escape character.
This prevents the quotes from being interpreted as the end of the string.

<!-- Multiline Strings:  -->

JavaScript supports multiline strings using template literals (enclosed within backticks). This
allows for easier formatting and inclusion of line breaks within the string.

<!-- String Length:  -->

The length property is introduced, which allows you to determine the number of characters in a string.

<!-- Accessing Characters:  -->

Strings can be treated as arrays of characters, and individual characters can be accessed using
square brackets and the index position.

<!-- String Methods:  -->

The article covers several commonly used string methods, such as indexOf(), slice(), replace(), and
split(). Each method is explained along with examples of their usage.

<!-- Immutable Nature of Strings:  -->

Strings in JavaScript are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed directly. Instead,
string methods return modified copies of the original string.

<!-- Finding the position of a substring in a string: -->

You can determine the position of a specific substring within a larger string using the indexOf() method. It returns the
index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if the substring is not found.
Extracting a substring from a string:

You can extract a portion of a string using the slice() method. It takes two parameters: the starting index and the
ending index (optional), and returns the extracted substring.
Changing case:

JavaScript provides methods to convert the case of a string. The toUpperCase() method converts all characters to
uppercase, while the toLowerCase() method converts them to lowercase.
Updating parts of a string:

You can replace specific parts of a string using the replace() method. It takes two parameters: the substring to be
replaced and the new substring. It only replaces the first occurrence by default, but you can use regular expressions
with the /g flag to replace all occurrences.

<!-- Template Literals:  -->

Template literals provide a way to create more dynamic strings by embedding variables or expressions
within the string using placeholders (${expression}). This is demonstrated with examples.
